## Introduction

Recycle Me is an Sustainable Living App Android platform that can make it easier for users, especially Indonesians, to recycle waste. In this application there are 3 main features, namely:
- Complete recycling articles with 8 waste categories
- Scan trash along with recommended articles about recycling
- Coin rewards that can be exchanged for E-Wallet balance

## Our Goals
- Educate and Raise Awareness: Our primary goal is to educate users about the importance of recycling and raise awareness about sustainable living practices. Through comprehensive recycling articles covering eight waste categories, we aim to provide users with valuable information on how to effectively manage and recycle different types of waste.

- Facilitate Convenient Recycling: We strive to make recycling more accessible and convenient for users by implementing a trash scanning feature. This feature will allow users to easily identify and categorize various types of waste through their mobile devices. Additionally, the app will provide recommended articles on recycling specific to the scanned waste, promoting informed recycling practices.

- Incentivize Sustainable Behavior: To encourage users to actively participate in recycling efforts, we have introduced a coin rewards system. Users will earn coins for their recycling activities, and these coins can be redeemed for E-Wallet balance. By providing tangible rewards, we aim to motivate users to adopt and maintain sustainable behavior in their daily lives.
